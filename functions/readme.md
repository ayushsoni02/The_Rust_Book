Statements and Expressions:

- Statements are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value.
- Expressions evaluate to a resultant value.

Statements do not return values. Therefore, you canâ€™t assign a let statement to another variable.

Expressions do not include ending semicolons. If you add a semicolon to the end of an expression, you turn it into a statement, and it will then not return a value. Keep this in mind as you explore function return values and expressions next.

Calling a function is an expression. Calling a macro is an expression. A new scope block created with curly brackets is an expression.
